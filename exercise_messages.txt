Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
The pain you feel today will be the strength you feel tomorrow.
Sweat is fat crying.
Don't stop until you're proud.
Your body can stand almost anything. It’s your mind that you have to convince.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Train like a beast, look like a beauty.
Strive for progress, not perfection.
The only bad workout is the one you didn’t do.
Success starts with self-discipline.
