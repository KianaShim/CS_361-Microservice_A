The expert in anything was once a beginner.
Don’t stop until you’re proud.
The more you learn, the more you earn.
Stay focused and never give up.
Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
Dream big, work hard, stay focused.
The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow.
Knowledge is power.
Stay positive, work hard, and make it happen.
