Do something today that your future self will thank you for.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing.
Work hard in silence, let your success be your noise.
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.
Dreams don’t work unless you do.
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.
Success is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.
The future depends on what you do today.
Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time.
