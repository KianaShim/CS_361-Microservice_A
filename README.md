# CS-361 Microservice A
This is the microservice that I created for my teammate. To use it, they need to utilize the subprocess module in Python, and pass in the user inputted category. The output from the microservice will then be captured.

A category (exercise, work, study) must be given in order to start the program. The microservice will then read the user inputted category and select a random message from the respective text file, and return it as a string. It can then be adapted into the main program UI as one of the options a user can select.
